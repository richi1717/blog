# Post About Favorite Lesson Today

Today Brad n Brig taught us how to use jekyll with a more in-depth style.  Brad helped out quite a bit until a family emergency made his presence disappear.  Brig took over and went super fast, about as fast as a [Super Saiyan](http://assets.audiomack.com/roshoun/368f10d3bc23b82ed1b1a233ce0a977e.png) but we somehow understood it.  Life is ok.

My favorite lesson today was when we learned about sending it to github from terminal.  The more I learn about terminal the more I enjoy it.  It's just easier and faster to do it there.

To be honest, today was a tad confusing.  The speed sucked and whatnot but oh well.  Figured it out by way of just doing it. Duane sucks.
